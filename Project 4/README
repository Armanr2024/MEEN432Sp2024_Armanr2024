Start by executing P4init.m, then proceed to open and run Project_4.slx. Following this, navigate to Project_4_Run.m and execute it as well. During the simulation, the car completes approximately 19 laps and concludes with a state of charge (SOC) of around 45%. Despite manually scrutinizing the regenerative braking system for violations and finding none, the console continues to display a "True" boolean. This persistent issue stems from a discrepancy within the brake logic function, resulting in the vehicle being flagged for regenerative braking violations. It's perplexing as the remainder of the system appears to be functioning as expected prior to the integration of this particular feature into the Simulink model.
